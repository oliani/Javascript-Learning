# Javascript Learning
---
Repo with all of my fisrt **javascript** codes writed while learning by myself.

First archives are in HTML format and I have placed the javascript code inside it just so make easier to see what am I doing using HTML and CSS. 

The main trajetory I made is based on "Curso em vídeo - Curso de Javascript"

I had previeous programming **logic, C, C++, Java, HTML** and **CSS** knowledge.
